<h3>SoBigData Award for Diversity and Inclusion</h3>

Computer and Data science currently fail to adequately address equality and diversity issues, as there are genders and minorities which remain woefully underrepresented. The European Integrated Infrastructure for Social Mining and Big Data Analytics, the [SoBigData++ Horizon2020 project](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/871042) has a mandate to promote equality and has established an award to promote a more diverse participation in computer and data science events. SoBigData++ has created the <b>SoBigData Award for Diversity and Inclusion</b> aimed at fostering participation from underrepresented groups, providing support to cover costs connected with the participation in computer and data science events.
