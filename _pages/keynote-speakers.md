<h3>Talk: Mobilizing the Queer Community in AI Policy</h3>
<b>Abstract:</b> Effective regulation of AI is vital for ensuring AI advances our goals of equity, diversity, inclusion, and justice. Legislative and regulatory bodies across the world are currently deciding how to regulate AI, and how to operationalize those regulations. However, marginalized communities often lack political power and networks to ensure their perspectives are heard when creating regulations. In this talk, I provide some background on current efforts to regulate AI and how they consider (or fail to consider) EDI. I then discuss Queer in AI's policy engagement strategy, showing how we have educated and mobilized our community to grow our impact and highlighting specific challenges marginalized communities face when doing policy work. Finally, I discuss Queer in AI's specific policy engagements and positions, and how they may lead to more just AI.

    <b>Bio:</b> Dr. William Agnew is a CBI postdoc fellow at CMU. William received his Ph.D. from University of Washington with Sidd Srinivasa, where he worked on AI ethics, critical AI, and robotics. William also helped found Queer in AI. William is interested in developing and sharing tools and ideas that go beyond participatory design and allow marginalized individuals and communities to own and meaningfully control their data and models derived from that data. Building on ideas from usable security/privacy, usage licenses, and indigenous data sovereignty, William wants to contribute to data and AI futures where individuals and communities know where their data is and can remove, add, or change their data in different datasets.
